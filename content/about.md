Hello, I'm a musicologist and (mostly amateur) musician currently living in Fort Wayne, Indiana. I am a clinical assistant professor of music theory and musicology at the Purdue University Fort Wayne School of Music.

I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2011 and earned my PhD in musicology from Brandeis University in 2021 with a dissertation on composers' importations of popular theater genres into—to borrow from historian, William Weber—high-prestige music making. My research focuses on music, history and aesthetics in German-speaking lands and the United States after 1800. I'm especially interested in ways that cultural hierarchies interact in, and across, various repertoires. Lately, I've turned my attention toward the voice and vocality in film and theater (musical or spoken). Among other topics, I have researched and written on:

* late 18th-century/early 19th-century popular theater and its influence on chamber and concert music during the 19th century
* transatlantic German popular theater practices, focused on German-American communities in the American Midwest
* mutual influences between spoken theater and music
* the voice as a site of identity and power in film and theater
* ways music contributed to aesthetics around revolution in the first half of the 19th century in Europe
* how music streaming service users form virtual communities ([link](https://musicologynow.org/whither-musicologist/))
* how individuals form and express artistic identities, focused on [Sophie Schröder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Schr%C3%B6der)
* structures of commendation and honor for 19th-century German musicians, focused on Clara Schumann
* gender representation in US-ian classical music radio programming (an ongoing collaborative project with my wife, Kathryn, which will soon be publicly hosted on this website)
* middlebrow culture, American opera, and Cold War-era middle-class anxieties, focusing on Samuel Barber
* currently working on an essay on Robert Schumann as a conductor


I have previously taught at Framingham State University, Northeastern University, Brandeis University, Harvard University, Longy School of Music, and lectured in Brandeis's Osher Lifelong Learning program. For much of my time in Boston, I was a member, assistant music director, music director and board member for Calliope, an orchestral and choral ensemble in Boston. Amateur music making is near and dear to me, though my participation in it has been on pause during the pandemic. You can find more information in my CV, posted on this site.
